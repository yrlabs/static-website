After fumbling around wix, squarespace, cargo, wordpress and random ventures into python, markdown, R and javascript,
I have finally come to the conclusion that in a world where the internet is essentially mankind's public toilet,
where everyone's shit is rolled around until it becomes more shit,
there is nothing better than a plain, straightforward html webiste.
No ostentatious UI, no gimmicks, no parallex scrolling, nothing unnecessary, nothing excessive, 
verified information with just the basic furniture. 
So my new (and hopefully final) webiste is going to be the most mundane one you could ever imagine.
Times New Roman, a few links to specific projects, headers and paragraphs, some videos and images.
100% html and css.
